i am building a new website for casa dodo guatape (@https://casadodoguatape.com/ )

it's a boutique hotel with 1-3 bedroom apartments. there is a asian fusion restaurant downstairs. 

i want to change it into a one-pager.

they are using lobbypms.com for managing the bookings as this integrates with booking.com and airbnb. keep this. they want to keep using it. 

site should be multi-lingual (en, es and fr)

different sections:
- [x] header (logo left, right: es, fr, book now cta)
- [x] welcome hero banner with book now cta
- [x] reviews
- [ ] logistics (address, location)
- [x] apartments
- [ ] about
- [ ] contact
- [x] apartment 1 about. (main photo, description, carousel photos)
- [x] apartment 1 gallery. (main photo, description, carousel photos)
- [x] apartment 2 about. (main photo, description, carousel photos)
- [x] apartment 2 gallery. (main photo, description, carousel photos)
- [x] apartment 3 about. (main photo, description, carousel photos)
- [x] apartment 3 gallery. (main photo, description, carousel photos)
- [ ] footer (copyright, built with love by ramiro etc.)

i am using hugo ssg and want to use tina so that they can change some things themselves. and then host it on render. i don't expect a lot of traffic. i do want to track traffic. which analytics are currently best? 

and SEO is most important. should be for people looking to visit guatape.
