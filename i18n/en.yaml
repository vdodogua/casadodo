# about
spotlight4_title: "About Us"
spotlight4_content: >
  We are your hosts, Valery and Javier. Casa Dodo is our home and also where we welcome you, our guest.

  The name comes from:
  (1) The native extinct bird of Mauritius and
  (2) From “dodo”, a short form of the French verb “dormir” which means to sleep.
  
  We have 3 apartments in the building, sleeping 2, 4 and 6 guests. We bought the building in 2017 and started renovations a year later. We welcomed our first guests in December 2019. Our aim is to offer tasteful but functional lodging where you can relax while enjoying the village we love. We strive to offer hotel comfort with the additional space and amenities a home provides.
